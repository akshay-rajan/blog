- **Insert Mode**: For inserting text. Enter by pressing `i`, `a`, `o`, etc.
- **Visual Mode**: For selecting text. Enter by pressing `v` (character-wise), `V` (line-wise), or `Ctrl+v` (block-wise).
- **Command-Line Mode**: For executing commands. Enter by pressing `:` in Normal mode.
- **Replace Mode**: For replacing existing text. Enter by pressing `R`.
- **Ex Mode**: For executing multiple commands. Enter by pressing `Q`.

## Custom Key Mappings

Vim allows users to create custom key mappings to enhance productivity:

```vim

```


These mappings can be added to the `.vimrc` file for persistence.
