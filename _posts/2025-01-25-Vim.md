# Vim

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable, efficient, and powerful text editor, widely used by developers and system administrators. It is an enhanced version of the Unix `vi` editor, offering extensive features for text editing. 

---

## Modes

Vim operates in multiple modes, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Normal Mode**: Default mode for navigation and command execution.
- **Insert Mode**: For inserting text. Enter by pressing `i`, `a`, `o`, etc.
- **Visual Mode**: For selecting text. Enter by pressing `v` (character-wise), `V` (line-wise), or `Ctrl+v` (block-wise).
- **Command-Line Mode**: For executing commands. Enter by pressing `:` in Normal mode.
- **Replace Mode**: For replacing existing text. Enter by pressing `R`.
- **Ex Mode**: For executing multiple commands. Enter by pressing `Q`.

## Basic Commands

### Opening and Saving Files

```bash
vim filename       # Open or create a file
:w                 # Save changes
:w filename        # Save as a new file
:q                 # Quit
:q!                # Quit without saving
:wq or :x          # Save and quit
```

### Inserting Text

```bash
i    # Insert before cursor
I    # Insert at beginning of line
a    # Append after cursor
A    # Append at end of line
o    # Open new line below
O    # Open new line above
```

### Navigating Within a File

```bash
h    # Move left
j    # Move down
k    # Move up
l    # Move right
0    # Move to beginning of line
^    # Move to first non-blank character of line
$    # Move to end of line
w    # Move to beginning of next word
b    # Move to beginning of previous word
e    # Move to end of word
gg   # Go to beginning of file
G    # Go to end of file
:n   # Go to line number n
```

The navigation commands can be prefixed with a number.
For example, typing `5j` would move us 5 lines down.

More navigations:

```bash
f[char] # Jump to the next occurence of a character
F[char] # Jump to the previous occurence of a character
t[char] # Jump to the position before the next occurence of a character
daw     # Delete a word
( or )  # Move by sentences
{ or }  # Move by paragraphs
Ctrl + D or Ctrl + U # Move by half-a-page
Ctrl + F or Ctrl + B # Move by a full page
```

### Editing Text

```bash
x    # Delete character under cursor
dd   # Delete current line
dw   # Delete word from cursor
d$   # Delete to end of line
u    # Undo last change
Ctrl+r  # Redo undone change
yy   # Yank (copy) current line
p    # Paste after cursor
P    # Paste before cursor
r + [char]   # Replace current character with new one 
s    # Delete current char and enter into insert mode
yi{  # Copy everything inside the '{}' (works with {}, (), [])
ya{  # Copy everything inside the '{}' including the brackets
di[{, (, [] # Delete everything inside brackets
```

### Visual Mode Operations

```bash
v    # Start visual mode (character-wise)
V    # Start visual mode (line-wise)
Ctrl+v  # Start visual block mode
y    # Yank selected text
d    # Delete selected text
>    # Indent selected text
<    # Unindent selected text
```

### Searching and Replacing

```bash
/pattern           # Search forward for 'pattern'
?pattern           # Search backward for 'pattern'
n                  # Repeat last search in same direction
N                  # Repeat last search in opposite direction
:%s/old/new/g      # Replace all occurrences of 'old' with 'new' in file
:%s/old/new/gc     # Replace with confirmation
```

### Working with Multiple Files

```bash
:split filename    # Split window and open 'filename'
:vsplit filename   # Vertical split with 'filename'
:tabnew filename   # Open 'filename' in new tab
gt                 # Go to next tab
gT                 # Go to previous tab
```

### Miscellaneous Commands

```bash
:set number        # Show line numbers
:set nonumber      # Hide line numbers
:set syntax=on     # Enable syntax highlighting
:set syntax=off    # Disable syntax highlighting
:help keyword      # Open help for 'keyword'
```

## Custom Key Mappings

Vim allows users to create custom key mappings to enhance productivity:

```vim
:map <F5> :w<CR>   # Map F5 to save file
:imap jj <Esc>     # Map 'jj' in insert mode to escape to normal mode
```


These mappings can be added to the `.vimrc` file for persistence.

## Vim in VS Code

We can use the *Vim (vscodevim)* extension in VS Code to use the Vim keybindings. 
Thus the same modes, navigations and vim motions will work inside VS Code.
We can include custom key mappings like remapping `jj` to `Esc` like this:

1. `Ctrl + Shift + P` â†’ **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** (opening `settings.json`)
2. Enter the code block below:

```json
"vim.insertModeKeyBindings": [
  {
    "before": ["j", "j"],
    "after": ["<Esc>"]
  }
]
```
Some keybindings I use by editing `keybindings.json`:

```json
{
		"key": "alt+win+v",
		"command": "toggleVim"
},
{
		"key": "ctrl+w",
		"command": "workbench.action.closeActiveEditor",
		"when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
		"key": "ctrl+p",
		"command": "workbench.action.quickOpen",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && !inQuickOpen && !accessibleViewIsShown"
}
```

## Extras

- To set the numbering relative to the current number, run `:set relativenumber`. This allows us to move forward with `[number]` and move backward with `[number]k`.
- If you are at an opening bracket, to move to the closing bracket, press `%`.
- To make the yank(`y`) and paste(`p`) commands work with the system keyboard, add `"vim.useSystemClipboard": true` to `settings.json`.
